This is a deceiving sntp server. To launch, open CLI in the same directory and type "python launcher.py". You may also pass some arguments to change how it will be working. Settings: port via command -p/--port [port_number]("ntp"/43 by default); server via command -s/--server [server_name]('pool.ntp.org' by default); delay via command -d/--delay [seconds](0 by default); -D turns on the debug mode.
